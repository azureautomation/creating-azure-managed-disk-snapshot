Creating Azure Managed Disk Snapshot
====================================

            

A Managed Snapshot is a read-only full copy of a managed disk which is stored as a standard managed disk by default. With snapshots, you can back up your managed disks at any point in time. 



This script run on the resources with TagName as 'Environment' and TagValue as 'Staging'. You can also automate the process of managed disk snapshot by publishing the script in Azure Automation as well with few changes.

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
